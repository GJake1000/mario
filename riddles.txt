To the blind I am nothing,|to the traveller I am everything.|I am the sun held in your hand.|What am I?
A Sword
A Torch
The Moon
A Light bulb

To break the wall that blocks your way|Return to where you started play|I have a fuse but cannot speak|My thunder makes the stone grow weak
Rusty Key
Heavy Hammer
Dynamite Spell
Bomb

The more of them you take,|the more you leave behind.|What are they?
